# Build Sprint 2

To begin work on this ticket, make sure you have finished: 
1. Getting locally setup. 
2. Completed the `Onboarding Module` in your course. 
3. Completed Build Sprint 1. 

### Objective

Deliver the following: 

- Graphs page that matches the graphs page on the [screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BloomTech-Labs/asylum-rg-fe-starter/main/tickets/examples/graphs-main.png). 
- While you may make small changes to styles, the page should mostly match what is provided. 
- Currently, there is an error stopping the graphs from rendering. You must debug the error and ensure it showcases the graphs as shown on the deployed site. 

### Relevant Files

You must inspect the React code in `src/components/pages/DataVisualizations` for this error. 

### Guidance

Debugging is an important skill for every dev to have. Your job is to find the error and ensure that the page on your local setup looks the same as the one deployed. The time series, heat map, and heat map by origin should all render correctly. 

You must: 

1. Focus on making the graphs page for the browser. You can adjust the styles for mobile and tablet in the stretch goals of this project after you complete all 3 tickets.

2. Do not use a Node version higher than 16.16.0. If you are, you can use `nvm` (for Mac) or `nvm-windows` to easily toggle your node versions in directories. 

3. Make this project your own, but keep the integrity of the main files so that the app can render and work when you wish to present it. 

## Deliverables 

Submit the following in your course: 

- Link to your forked repo with the fixed code for the graphs page
- Link to a Loom video answering the prompt in the `Submit Your Deliverables` assignment in your course
