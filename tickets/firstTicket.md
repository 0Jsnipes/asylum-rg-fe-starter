# Build Sprint 1

To begin work on this ticket, make sure you have finished: 
1. Getting locally setup. 
2. Completed the onboarding module on Canvas. 

## Objective

Deliver the following: 
- Landing page that matches the landing page on the [deployed site](https://asylum-rg-fe.vercel.app/). 
- While you may make small changes to styles, the page should mostly match what is provided. 

## Relevant Files

Your React code should be added to `RenderLandingPage.jsx`. 
Your styles should be added to `RenderLandingPage.less`.

There are comments in both files to guide you and show you where to add code. 

## Guidance

Your job is to finish building the landing page for this application. To build this, you will add to the existing React component structure and alter styles to match the provided reference on the deployed site. 

You should make sure: 
1. You are focusing on making the landing page for the browser. You can adjust the styles for mobile and tablet in the stretch goals of this project after you complete all 3 tickets.
2. You use the exact imports on the `RenderLandingPage.jsx` file. This way you have the same photos and libraries available to you as the deployed site. 
3. You are not using a node version higher than 16.16.0. If you are, you can use `nvm` (for Mac) or `nvm-windows` to easily toggle your node versions in directories. 
4. It is important to make this project your own, but keep the integrity of the main files so that the app can render and work when you wish to present it. 

## Deliverables 

Submit the following on Canvas: 
- Link to your forked repo with the added code for the landing page
- Link to a Loom video answering the prompt in the Canvas assignment
